IPtable LAB:

In this Lab, we will secure the development environment by making use of iptables.

Wherever required, use sudo to run commands as the root user. Bob's password is caleston123.

Here is the simple architecture diagram of the implementation. This is a two-tier application. 

The web server is hosted on devapp01.

The DB server is hosted on devdb01.

The Software Repository is hosted on caleston-repo-01.

Here are the connectivity requirements:
SSH should be allowed from Bob's laptop to both Web and DB servers.
HTTP/80 from the Web Server should be accessible from Bob's laptop.
The Web Server should be able to access the Software Repository server at port 80
