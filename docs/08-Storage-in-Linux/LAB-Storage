LAB 1 :  Storage-Basics

This lab requires some commands to be run as the root user. Always use sudo.

Bob's default password is caleston123

Q1: How many disk type block devices are present in the system?

S: Run: lsblk and look for disk devices

Q2: How many maximum partitions (primary or extended ) can an MBR have?

S: MBR can have up to 4 partitions.

Q3: Create a GPT partition called vdb1 of size 500M on the disk /dev/vdb

You can install gdisk by running sudo apt install gdisk

S: Run: sudo gdisk /dev/vdb

  In the interactive prompt, enter n

  Select parition number = 1 (for vdd1)

  Select default first sector = 2048

  Select +500M when asked for last sector

  Use default hex code = 8300

  Finally type w to write to the partition table


LAB 2 :  Filesystem

This lab requires some commands to be run as the root user. Always use sudo.

Bob's default password is caleston123

Q1: Which of the following filesystems does not use a journal?

S: EXT2 does not use a journal and hence has longer recovery boot time.

Q2: Out of the disks /dev/vdb and /dev/vdc, which one has a filesystem created?

S: Run: sudo df -h
  /dev/vdc is mounted at /mnt/backups. This is only possible if it has a filesystem.

Q3: Can you find out the type of filesystem created in /dev/vdc?

  Use the blkid command with the disk name as the argument.

S: Run: sudo blkid /dev/vdc      
  => (TYPE="ext2")

Q4: Create an ext4 filesystem on the disk /dev/vdb and mount it at /mnt/data

S: Run: sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb

  sudo mkdir /mnt/data

  sudo mount /dev/vdb /mnt/data

  sudo df -h

Q5: What would happen to the mount /mnt/data after a system reboot?

S: The mount is not persistent in FSTAB yet. If the system is rebooted, the filesystem will not be mounted

Q6: Make the mount persistent across reboot.

Use rw option with the dump and pass numbers both set to 0

S:  Add it in the FSTAB
    Run: sudo vi /etc/fstab

    Add the line /dev/vdb /mnt/data ext4 rw 0 0

    Save and Exit.
