LAB 1 :  Storage-Basics

This lab requires some commands to be run as the root user. Always use sudo.

Bob's default password is caleston123

Q1: How many disk type block devices are present in the system?

S: Run: lsblk and look for disk devices

Q2: How many maximum partitions (primary or extended ) can an MBR have?

S: MBR can have up to 4 partitions.

Q3: Create a GPT partition called vdb1 of size 500M on the disk /dev/vdb

You can install gdisk by running sudo apt install gdisk

S: Run: sudo gdisk /dev/vdb

  In the interactive prompt, enter n

  Select parition number = 1 (for vdd1)

  Select default first sector = 2048

  Select +500M when asked for last sector

  Use default hex code = 8300

  Finally type w to write to the partition table


LAB 2 :  Filesystem

This lab requires some commands to be run as the root user. Always use sudo.

Bob's default password is caleston123

Q1: Which of the following filesystems does not use a journal?

S: EXT2 does not use a journal and hence has longer recovery boot time.

Q2: Out of the disks /dev/vdb and /dev/vdc, which one has a filesystem created?

S: Run: sudo df -h
  /dev/vdc is mounted at /mnt/backups. This is only possible if it has a filesystem.

Q3: Can you find out the type of filesystem created in /dev/vdc?

  Use the blkid command with the disk name as the argument.

S: Run: sudo blkid /dev/vdc      
  => (TYPE="ext2")

Q4: Create an ext4 filesystem on the disk /dev/vdb and mount it at /mnt/data

S: Run: sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb

  sudo mkdir /mnt/data

  sudo mount /dev/vdb /mnt/data

  sudo df -h

Q5: What would happen to the mount /mnt/data after a system reboot?

S: The mount is not persistent in FSTAB yet. If the system is rebooted, the filesystem will not be mounted

Q6: Make the mount persistent across reboot.

Use rw option with the dump and pass numbers both set to 0

S:  Add it in the FSTAB
    Run: sudo vi /etc/fstab

    Add the line /dev/vdb /mnt/data ext4 rw 0 0

    Save and Exit.



LAB 3 : LVM (LOGICAL VOLUME MANAGER )


This lab requires some commands to be run as the root user. Always use sudo.

Bob's default password is caleston123

Q1: Is LVM installed on this machine?



S: Try out commands such as pvdisplay or lvs 

    ==> Yes

Q2: LVM is installed on this machine and you will find that a physical volume has already been created.

    What is the name of this physical volume?

S: Run: pvdisplay

    ==>   PV Name               /dev/vda1

Q: What is the size of this physical volume?

S: Run: pvdisplay and lsblk to verify the size

    ==>   PV Size               <10.00 GiB / not usable 2.00 MiB   = 10GB

Q4: What is the name of the volume group created using this PV?

S: Run: pvdisplay or vgdisplay

  ==> VG Name               vagrant-vg

Q5: Now, we will create a new VG. To do this we will make use of the disks /dev/vdb and /dev/vdc

    What are the size of these disks individually?

S: Run: sudo lsblk and inspect the size of disks. Each disk is of size 1G.

Q6: Create PV's using /dev/vdb and /dev/vdc.

S: Run: sudo pvcreate /dev/vdb and sudo pvcreate /dev/vdc

    $ sudo pvcreate /dev/vdb; sudo pvcreate /dev/vdc

Q7: Create a new volume group called caleston_vg using the newly created PV's

S: Run: sudo vgcreate caleston_vg /dev/vdb /dev/vdc

Q8: Create a new logical volume called data from the caleston_vg.

    Size of the volume should be 1G

S: Run: sudo lvcreate -L 1G -n data caleston_vg

Q9: Create a new logical volume called data from the caleston_vg.

  Size of the volume should be 1G

S: Run: sudo lvcreate -L 1G -n data caleston_vg

Q10: Create an ext4 filesystem on this logical volume and mount it at /mnt/media

S: Run: sudo mkdir /mnt/media
  sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/caleston_vg-data
  sudo mount /dev/mapper/caleston_vg-data /mnt/media/

Q11: Add 500M to the logical volume called data.

  Do not unmount the filesystem.

S: Run: sudo lvresize -L +500M -n /dev/mapper/caleston_vg-data

  sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/caleston_vg-data
